# Health Relate Grant Checking and Predition

The US government invests billions each year into the health research. The “open government” initiative provides more transparency into the governmental activities in the health related sector. Grant application data from NIH, ACF, AHRQ, CDC, HRSA, FDA, and VA are now easily accessible. With that large amount of data, we can now track the trend of the health research according to the amount of grant money. What research topics/areaes get more attractive? How have they been changing over the years? What area in the health sector will likely be the next breakthrough? I will try to explore those questions from the grant application database.
